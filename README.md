# Math Buddy

A tool to help kids with math!

A small project for the LaunchHacks Hackathon June 3 - June 5 2022.

## The Theme For the Hackathon

The theme is that your project must address a problem and create something to help address the issues. My problem here is that some kids have trouble with basic math, so I created a basic math problem application to help kids practice with. It comes with a scoring system to keep track of their accuracy and a timer to test their ability to see how much they can do.
