# Math Buddy

A tool to help kids with math!

A small project for the LaunchHacks Hackathon June 3 - June 5 2022.

## The Theme For the Hackathon

The theme is that your project must address a problem and create something to help address the issues. My problem here is that some kids have trouble with basic math, so I created a basic math problem application to help kids practice with. It comes with a scoring system to keep track of their accuracy and a timer to test their ability to see how much they can do. 

## Inspiration

I have a little brother who struggles with math and I help him by making practice problems. I got the idea to make an application to not only generate these practice problems, but also add a bit of challenge to help make it interesting.

## What it does

It creates math problems for the user to answer. It comes with a scoring system to keep track of their accuracy and a timer to test their ability to see how much they can do.

## How we built it

Built with React and the Material UI framework for react.

## Challenges we ran into

The main challenge was to think about how to change this from just a random problem generator to something not as dull. I settled on a time challenge and a score system given the time constraints.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I like how practical this can be since I have a person who could benefit from this.

## What we learned

I learnt more about React components interaction with each other via functions and use states

## What's next for Math Buddy

I would add more options, such as difficulty. Another feature I would implement would be more challenges, such as seeing how many correct questions you can get in a row.

## Running

To run the test build, after downloading the files run

``` 
npm install
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm start
```
